# QuartzLand Project for BDSX (Minecraft Bedrock Edition)
This is private (now public) repository for game server QuartzLand Project
Even though the repository is old, I hope the code I wrote a long time ago will help someone with their ideas.

# Why have I opened it?
The reason is simple, migration of the project to another architecture C# + Rust. 
NodeJS can not withstand a large number of complex operations, because of this the server lags. The second reason - the project is closed. 
I was no longer interested in maintaining it. The new version of the project is in a closed repository, maybe I will open it some day, but certainly not today.
